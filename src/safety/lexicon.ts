/**
 * The crisis lexicon — a REVIEWABLE, VERSIONED config the deterministic detector
 * reads. It is recall-biased BY DESIGN: this path routes a student to humans, so
 * a false positive (a caring adult is told, resources are shown) is acceptable and
 * a false negative is not. It never assesses the student; it only decides whether
 * to route.
 *
 * Two tiers:
 *   · tier_1 — explicit intent/plan language → escalate immediately.
 *   · tier_2 — concerning, ideation-adjacent language → escalate, lower urgency.
 *
 * Change control (P16 acceptance): every edit to the sources below MUST bump
 * `LEXICON_VERSION` and append a `LEXICON_CHANGELOG` entry recording the new
 * content hash. The lock test fails CI on any content change that isn't recorded,
 * so the lexicon can never drift silently. The changelog is append-only.
