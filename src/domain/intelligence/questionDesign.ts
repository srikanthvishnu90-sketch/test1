/**
 * Research-grounded rules for FORMULATING student reflection questions, focused on
 * high schoolers (plumb's audience, ages ~14–18). Kids don't always self-report
 * truthfully: they agree to be nice (acquiescence / yea-saying), answer questions
 * they can't really know instead of saying "I don't know" (Waterman, Blades &
 * Spencer), and say what looks good (social desirability). Teens additionally
 * manage what they show behind a felt "imaginary audience" (Elkind) and want to be
 * their own boss (autonomy — Self-Determination Theory, Deci & Ryan).
 *
 * So this module encodes what the research says makes a question honest and
 * answerable, and flags the anti-patterns. It is pure and deterministic — a
 * guardrail over generated questions, never a model. Full write-up with citations:
 * docs/question-design.md.
