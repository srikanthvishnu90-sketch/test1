/**
 * The non-diagnostic guard (spec → Product principle 4: "Do not diagnose").
 * Every AI-authored summary or message a teacher or student sees must pass this
 * before it leaves the system. It permits transient, observed language
 * ("reported feeling rushed", "appears hesitant to ask for help") and forbids
 * clinical labels and fixed-trait verdicts about a student.
 *
 * This is a CURATED, change-controlled list — like the crisis lexicon, its edits
 * are a deliberate safety decision, not a casual tweak. It is intentionally
 * conservative: better to reject a borderline phrase and re-draft than to let a
 * diagnosis reach a child's teacher.
