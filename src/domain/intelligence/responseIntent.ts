/**
 * Intent routing for a student's chat answer, plus the contextual follow-up an
 * unusable answer earns. This is the deterministic core of "handle any answer
 * gracefully": classify the reply (direct / off-topic / gibberish / refusal /
 * ambiguous) and, when it can't be used, produce a polite, question-anchored probe
 * instead of blindly moving on.
 *
 * Pure and zero-LLM by design — this is the always-works fallback. Per CLAUDE.md
 * the FLOW stays deterministic (the model never decides the next step); a language
 * adapter may reword the follow-up, but the routing decision is made here. This is
 * the plumb-native form of a "fallback intent-routing + dynamic contextual
 * prompting" system: the deterministic layer is layer-1 routing AND the fallback
 * for the model layer.
