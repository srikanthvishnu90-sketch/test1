/**
 * ReflectionIntelligence — the AI service seam for the reflection loop. It is

 * the deterministic adapter fulfils it with zero network so `pnpm check` and the
 * whole product run with no key (CLAUDE.md → "zero-LLM must work"). Every method
 * is labor: it drafts and structures. It never decides an intervention, computes
 * a gap, or sets a safety outcome — those stay in deterministic domain code.
 *
 * This first slice covers the teacher side (lesson → analysis → questions). The
 * adaptive student conversation and the student/class summaries land next, as
 * additional methods on this same port.
